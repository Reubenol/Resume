<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
<p>I am a dual UK and Canadian citizen and in March I moved to Prince George, BC from England. I’m currently in my eighth year of hospitality. I have purposefully been working in various roles and businesses to gain well-rounded experience as hospitality is my career choice. The past few years have been part-time alongside my degree in Engineering. I have had leadership roles and been offered others but can now commit all my working time to hospitality. 
<p>I have vast bartending experience and the recent months have allowed me to learn the Canadian style of service, which I much prefer. I have also served in many roles, as well as being a kitchen porter and chef. This variety has set me up for being appreciative and knowledgeable about all the roles needed for a successful hospitality business.
<p>I have shown leadership qualities throughout my life; being captain of my rugby and football teams growing up, being president of my schools final two years which was over 700 people, starting a summer camp in Barcelona and in other working roles. I understand the importance of having multiple leaders in a business and how vital the hierarchy is to success. I’m looking forward to furthering these hospitality and leadership skills, whilst being more than ready to have a permanent management role. I can provide more than five work references.

<h3>Employment</h3>
<h4>Bartender/ServerTrench Brewing and Distillery</h4>
    <p>Serving drinks was my primary responsibility working in this brewery, alongside selling kegs and other off sales. I was primarily a bartender, solely working behind the bar serving my bar seats and the restaurants drinks. Serving was another responsibility, and this gave me good experience of the Canadian style of service. It is a busy bar/restaurant which has given me a great insight into a different and higher style of service. It is more customer-focused through having more incentives for the staff, which is how service should be in my view.  
<h4>Bartender, Black Bull, Corbridge</h4>
    <p>Serving drinks, taking orders and running food were my main responsibilities working in this pub/restaurant. I oversaw the front of house when the manager was off, and this was valuable added experience in management. My knowledge of beers and cask ales improved and taking care of the cellar was one of my responsibilities. However, I knew going into this job I wanted to primarily improve my restaurant service and did this successfully. I now have well-rounded hospitality experience.  
<h4>Summer Camp Leader, Barcelona, Spain</h4>
    <p>Over three summers I organised a summer camp for around twenty children aged between five and twelve. A friend and I had this idea three years ago and it turned out to be very successful, such that she had carried it on into this year and the business has a very good reputation. 
    <p>We spent the seven-week periods doing all sorts of activities, sports and competitions, as well as projects, English lessons and music workshops.  This was a great responsibility and took a lot of work but was very successful, which has been proven with it being fully booked this year.

<h3>Education</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I am currently completing the end of my bachelors degree in mechanical engineering, which I am predicted a first-class in.</li>  
    <li>I speak a basic level of Spanish and Catalan.</li>
    <li>I am a qualified soccer and rugby referee.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Achivements</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Northumberland County u16 and u18 rugby teams, in which I captained the u16s. Following on from this I was chosen to be part of the local Premiership academy, Newcastle Falcons. At university, I captained the rugby team to our first win against our local university rival in eight years.    
    </li>
    <li>In my final year of school, I was chosen to be President by my peers. This involved organising several parties and sporting events throughout the year, as well as the end of school prom and party. I was also trusted by the schools management to make financial decisions with money raised for the sixth form, as well as controlling all the finances for the events mentioned. We also held an end-of-school overnight party in a castle, with over two hundred guests, which was a great success and raised £2000 for charity.    
    </li>
    <li>During my time as a chef, I was chosen to assist two Masterchef semi-finalists on two occasions. We made an eight-course meal on both occasions, for seventy covers. Both my cooking and presenting skills were notably improved, as well as giving me an insight into the highest end of my profession at that time.      
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Interests</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I have played rugby since I was four years old, which has since been one of my main interests. I have recently stopped playing rugby but regularly watch this and football. </li>
    <li>I am also interested in tennis, cricket, f1 and football, in which I have played the latter all my life. </li>
    <li>Maths and engineering have also been a keen interest throughout my life, which led to me choosing engineering at university.</li>
    <li>I am an eager traveller, having gone to countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, Australia, Canada and Spain both alone and with friends.</li>
    <li>I thoroughly enjoy cooking and being out in nature.</li>
